## Installation

To install Streamlit Textcomplete, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
pip install streamlit-textcomplete
```

## Usage

To use Streamlit Textcomplete in your Streamlit application, follow these steps:

1. Import the [`textcomplete`] function from the package.
2. Define your autocomplete (multiple) strategies.
3. Define standard streamlit textarea but give it a defined label
4. Initialize the textcomplete component with this label & your strategies.

Example:

```python
import streamlit as st
from textcomplete import textcomplete, StrategyProps

original_label: str = "Textcomplete Example"
txt: str = st.text_area(
    label=original_label,
    key="st_text_area_1",
)
# Define your autocomplete strategies
username_strategy = StrategyProps(
    id="userFullName",
    match="\\B@(\\w*)$",
    search=async_search_function,  # Define your async search function as JS string
    replace="([fullName]) => `${fullName}`",
    template="([fullName]) => `üßëüèª ${fullName}`",
)

# Initialize the textcomplete component
textcomplete(
    area_label=original_label,
    strategies=[username_strategy],
    max_count=5,
    # Additional options ...
)
```
